# Parks Passport

Looking for the perfect park in your neighborhood? Parks Passport is your answer! Easily search through a list of parks, neighborhoods and amenities available near you. (Sample data provided to start).

You can add an amenity to your park, or get rid of one.

### Some dependencies to install until we get Parks Passport live on the internet:

`npm install formik --save`

`npm install react-icons`



### For the backend, you also may need to run:

`pipenv install`

and 

`pipenv shell`

`cd server`

`python app.py`

It will be on port `5555`



### For the front end, run:

`npm install`

and 

`npm start`



We are still in MVP for Parks Passport - so you may notice some routes or code that is not used. These enhancements will be coming soon as we continue to build out and work on this project.
